# HTML Playground + Assistente Juridico

## Overview
This project delivers a two-in-one application: an **HTML Playground** for live code preview and an **Assistente Juridico** (Legal Assistant). The Legal Assistant is an AI-powered tool designed to process legal texts using prompts inspired by the Brazilian judicial AI system, Apoia. Its core purpose is to streamline legal document handling, analysis, and generation, aiming for enhanced efficiency and accuracy in legal operations.

The business vision is to provide a comprehensive, AI-driven solution for legal professionals, significantly reducing manual effort in document drafting, review, and analysis. This platform has the potential to capture a significant share of the legal tech market in Brazil by offering tailored features that address specific needs of the Brazilian legal system. The project ambitions include continuous improvement of AI models, integration with more judicial systems, and expansion of legal functionalities to become an indispensable tool for lawyers and legal entities.

## User Preferences
- Portuguese (BR) language for UI
- Simple, easy-to-use interface (user is not technical)
- Mobile-friendly design
- User wants results to persist (not disappear on page refresh)
- User works with large legal documents (up to 50MB)

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The application features a professional green (hsl 152) theme, suitable for legal contexts, with both light and dark modes. It is designed to be mobile-responsive, offering a seamless experience across devices. The Assistente Juridico is the main landing page, reflecting its primary importance.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: Built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui for a modern and responsive user interface. `wouter` is used for routing, and `TanStack Query` manages server state.
- **Backend**: An Express.js server handles API requests, with PostgreSQL and Drizzle ORM for data persistence.
- **AI Integration**: Leverages OpenAI models (gpt-4o for Premium, gpt-4o-mini for Econômico) via Replit AI Integrations.
- **Document Processing**:
    - **Text Extraction**: `pdf-parse` (v2) for PDFs and `mammoth` for Word documents enable text extraction from various file types.
    - **OCR**: Automatic OCR for scanned PDFs using `pdftoppm` and `Tesseract` (por+eng).
    - **Transcription**: `Whisper API` and `ffmpeg` are used for audio/video transcription (MP3, WAV, M4A, MP4, MOV, .opus, .ptt, .ogg).
- **Formatting Panel**: Built-in formatting settings dialog accessible from result toolbar. User can configure: font family (Times New Roman, Arial, Courier New, Calibri), font size (10-14pt), line spacing (1-2.5), text alignment (justify/left/center/right), paragraph indent (0-4cm), citation indent (2-5cm). Settings persist in localStorage and apply to both screen display and Word export. Designed for mobile use.
- **Financial Audit Calculator**: `/auditoria` page provides a judicial sentence calculator comparing scenarios (Bank vs. Sentence) with TJMG monetary correction, BCB rates, and detailed monthly memorials. It supports Word export and PDF printing.
- **PWA Support**: The application is installable as a Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline capabilities.
